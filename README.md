# language-generator

This is just storing the source, for now it procedurally generates a phonological inventory and a set of phonotactic constraints. I'm still experimenting with methods for generating grammars that conform to Greenberg's Universals, and working out a few kinks in how this would ideally work. For now, it's just generating the sounds and constraints of those sounds, though.
